/**
 * TriggerVolume LSL example
 *
 * A sample LSL script illustrating the use of collision_start/end events (at a
 * very basic level). A typical use case would be a transparent or invisible
 * phantom trigger volume controlling something else via private chat commands
 * as user avatars enter and exit it.
