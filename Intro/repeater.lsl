string name = "";

// set the key of the prim the repeater listens to, or NULL_KEY to listen to all prims, or llGetOwner() to listen to the owner of the prim the script is a part of, here...
key id = NULL_KEY;

// set the message the repeater listens for, or "" to listen for all messages, here...
string message = "";

// default state...
