/**
 * SitOnClick LSL example
 *
 * A simple script that allows the specification of a custom sit target, forces
 * a sit click-action and provides for custom handling of sit-down and stand-up
 * events. A typical use case would be an object serving as a sitting spot on
 * which avatars are to be seated in a certain way and which notifies some other
 * script about users sitting on it and standing up from it.
